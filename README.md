## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
The aim of the project is to pitch to investors a new idea of setting up a new bike sharing business. In order to convince the investors a bike sharing analysis is conducted on real life bike sharing business in New York City in order to understand how the business works and concepts that may impact the growth and prosperity of setting up such a business in another city.

## Link to my Tableau Public Story:

## Results:

Using Tableau I created visualizations that show the following:

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.

- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

- The length of time that bikes by Gender.

- The Trips by Weekday for Each Hour 

- The Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

- The User Trips by Gender by Weekday


## Summary: 

All the visualization have demonstrated the most relevant factors to consider when opening a new bike sharing business which will be set up in another city. We have used a bike sharing business in New York as a case study. It is considered essential and ideal to Conduct a business analysis on a real-life example of a similar business (bike sharing) when considering all factors that impact the prosperity and survival of a new business.

Two additional visuals that could help in the analysis could be as follows:

1- Rides by Month to get the peak month where bike sharing business is at the peak and versus the month where demand is at its lowest

2- Subscribers by month to see if the subscription is affected by months and which month has highest / lowest subscription
